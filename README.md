# Cpp_shapes

## Important info
* The Lab2 specs file list the requirements for this program that I wrote
* The main is in the file titled "testCCSC.cpp"
* There exist a test main file with the frustum and one without the frustum
* Both main files should work
* If you download the files make sure to put them all in the same folder if your going to try and run this program
